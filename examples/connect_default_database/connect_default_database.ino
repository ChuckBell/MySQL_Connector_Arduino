/*
  MySQL Connector/Arduino Example : connect with default database

  This example demonstrates how to connect to a MySQL server and specifying
  the default database when connecting. 

  For more information and documentation, visit the wiki:
  https://github.com/ChuckBell/MySQL_Connector_Arduino/wiki.

  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

  1) Change the address of the server to the IP address of the MySQL server
  2) Change the user and password to a valid MySQL user and password
  3) Connect a USB cable to your Arduino
  4) Select the correct board and port
  5) Compile and upload the sketch to your Arduino
  6) Once uploaded, open Serial Monitor (use 115200 speed) and observe

  If you do not see messages indicating you have a connection, refer to the
  manual for troubleshooting tips. The most common issues are the server is
  not accessible from the network or the user name and password is incorrect.

  Note: The MAC address can be anything so long as it is unique on your network.

MySQL Connector/Arduino
=======================
Have you ever wanted to connect your Arduino project to a database to either store the data you've collected or retrieve data saved to trigger events in your sketch? Well, now you can connect your Arduino project directly to a MySQL server without using an intermediate computer or a web- or cloud-based service. Having direct access to a database server means you can store data acquired from your project as well as check values stored in tables on the server.

This also means you can setup your own, local MySQL server to store your data further removing the need for Internet connectivity. If that is not an issue, you can still connect to and store data on a MySQL server via your network, Internet, or even in the cloud!

The MySQL Connector/Arduino is a library that permits you to do exactly that and more!

See the all new [wiki documentation](https://github.com/ChuckBell/MySQL_Connector_Arduino/wiki) for how to get starting using the library.
